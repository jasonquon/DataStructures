Program Description
********************
 Program spell checks a user provided file by implementing
 a hash table dictionary from a file received from the command line.

************
Compilation
************
 To compile this code:
 make main
 make testMain

 To run simulation:
 bin/main assets/"anyFile.txt"

 To run the testing program:
 bin/testMain

 make clean removes executable files

***************************************
Hash Function and Collision Resolution
***************************************
The key value is created by using the bitwise operator to shift the
bits 8 to the left then adding the ascii value of each character.
The table index is created by finding the remainder of key / size of table.
Although this hash creates a reasonable spread, there is still the occasional
collision. Separate chaining is used for collision resolution. If a key returns
the same index as another key, the new node becomes the front of the collision
list. (ie. the new node now points to the pre-existing value in the given index.)
This creates a "chain" of nodes with the same index that can still be identified
by their unique integer key.
